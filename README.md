# CloudResume-Resume-Builder
CloudResume is a lightweight, browser-first resume builder that combines an interactive resume editor with a deployable static site and a SQL-backed visitor counter. Create, preview, and export resume pages in the browser; host the result on AWS S3 and use AWS Lambda (or a small server) with Amazon RDS/Aurora to persist visit counts.
